  - id: Q-001
    category: organizational
    summary: "What is the typical budget range for product evaluations?"
    details: |
      When evaluating products, agents need to know if there is a general
      budget range or spending threshold to filter options. Without this,
      all price points are considered equally, which may waste evaluation
      effort on products outside the buyer's range. Should there be a
      default budget assumption, or should budget always be specified
      per-evaluation?

    priority: medium
    blocking: false
    context: >
      Encountered during product evaluations where options ranged widely
      in price. Without budget guidance, the full range must be evaluated.

  - id: Q-002
    category: legal
    summary: "Are there additional consumer protection policies beyond Missouri defaults?"
    details: |
      Missouri has standard consumer protection laws, but GreenWest LLC
      may want to adopt stricter internal standards for vendor vetting,
      minimum warranty requirements, or return window expectations that
      go beyond legal minimums. If such policies exist or should be
      established, they would become confirmed facts for agent reference.
    added_by: human:owner
    added_date: 2026-02-15
    priority: low
    blocking: false
    context: >
      General knowledge gap identified during initial knowledge base setup.

  - id: Q-003
    category: domain
    summary: "Should product evaluations include used/refurbished options?"
    details: |
      The current workflow and job descriptions focus on new products.
      It is unclear whether used, refurbished, or open-box items should
      be included in evaluations. This affects data collection scope,
      merchant tier classification, and warranty analysis. A confirmed
      policy would prevent repeated escalations on this question.
    added_by: agent:product_data_collector
    added_date: 2026-02-15
    priority: high
    blocking: false
    context: >
      Multiple evaluations have required clarification on whether to
      include non-new condition products. Currently escalated per-task.
