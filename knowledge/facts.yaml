# =============================================================================
# CONFIRMED FACTS - knowledge/facts.yaml
# =============================================================================
# Verified knowledge that agents can rely on when making decisions.
# Both agents and humans reference this file as a source of truth.
#
# REFERENCING: Use category paths to cite facts (e.g., legal/jurisdiction).
#   Categories: legal, organizational, domain, agent-behavior
#
# CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
#   fact          - Verified and authoritative. Agents treat as ground truth.
#   best-practice - Established convention. Follow unless explicitly overridden.
#   suggestion    - Recommended but flexible. Agents may adapt to context.
#   unknown       - Included for awareness but unverified. Agents must flag
#                   when relying on this and should escalate if decision-critical.
#
# LIFECYCLE:
#   Facts are immutable once confirmed. To correct or update a fact:
#   1. Move the old entry to archive.yaml with status: deprecated
#   2. Create a new entry here with a replaces field pointing to the old path
#   Never edit a confirmed fact in place - always deprecate and replace.
#
# SCOPE: Organization-wide. These facts apply across all repos and swarms
#   operating under GreenWest LLC unless a repo-specific override exists.

  - path: legal/jurisdiction
    summary: "GreenWest LLC operates under Missouri and US law"
    details: |
      GreenWest LLC is a company established in the state of Missouri, USA.
      When evaluating legal feasibility, compliance, regulatory questions, or
      consumer protection matters, apply Missouri state law and US federal law

      another jurisdiction (e.g., a product sold exclusively in the EU).

    summary: "Missouri and federal consumer protection laws are the baseline"
    details: |
      Product evaluations should consider Missouri's Merchandising Practices
      Act (Chapter 407 RSMo) and federal consumer protection regulations
      (FTC Act, CPSC standards) when assessing vendor practices, warranty
      claims, and return policies. Agents evaluating merchants should flag
      any practices that may conflict with these protections.

    summary: "Prefer transparency over assumption in all agent outputs"
    details: |
      When agents produce reports or recommendations, they should clearly
      state what they know, what they assumed, and what gaps remain.
      Stakeholders prefer honest uncertainty over false confidence.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - path: domain/data-source-priority
    summary: "Manufacturer specs are the highest-priority data source"
    details: |
      When collecting product data, prioritize sources in this order:
        1. Manufacturer official specifications and datasheets
        2. Major retailers (Amazon, Home Depot, B&H Photo, etc.)
        3. Aggregator sites and specification databases
        4. Avoid: user forums, social media, non-authoritative sources
      This hierarchy applies unless a specific evaluation context justifies
      deviation (e.g., niche products where manufacturer data is sparse).

      Tier 1 (Highly Reliable): Major retailers, manufacturer direct stores,
        established specialty retailers with strong return policies.
      Tier 2 (Reliable with Caveats): High-rated marketplace sellers
        (>95% positive, >1000 reviews), regional chains, authorized dealers.
      Tier 3 (Higher Risk): Limited-history sellers, international sellers,
        liquidators, gray market sources.
      Avoid: Poor-rated sellers, suspiciously low prices, non-authorized
        sellers for warranty-sensitive products, no-return-policy sellers.

  # AGENT BEHAVIOR
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - path: agent-behavior/no-inference-rule
    summary: "Agents flag uncertainty rather than infer"
    details: |
      When an agent encounters incomplete or ambiguous information, it must
      flag the gap rather than making assumptions or inferences. This applies
      to all roles. If a confirmed fact in this file (facts.yaml) covers the
      question, the agent may act on it without escalating. Otherwise, the
      agent should escalate to the appropriate party or add an entry to
      queue.yaml if the question is not blocking immediate work.

  - path: agent-behavior/queue-contribution
    summary: "Agents may add items to the knowledge queue"
    details: |
      When an agent identifies a knowledge gap, recurring assumption, or
      pattern that would benefit from a confirmed fact, it should add an
      entry to queue.yaml with added_by set to agent:<role_name>. The agent
      should continue its current task using escalation protocols for the
      immediate need, while the queue entry captures the broader knowledge
      gap for future resolution.
