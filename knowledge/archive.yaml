# =============================================================================
# KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE - knowledge/archive.yaml
# =============================================================================
# Deprecated and rejected items. This file preserves history for audit,
# context, and reference. It explains *why* things changed over time.
#
# STATUS VALUES:
#   deprecated - Was a confirmed fact in facts.yaml but is no longer current.
#                A replacement fact should exist; see the replaced_by field.
#   rejected   - Was in queue.yaml but determined to be invalid, out of scope,
#                or not applicable. The reason field explains why.
#
# LIFECYCLE:
#   - This file is append-only. Items here are never deleted.
#   - Deprecated facts: Move here from facts.yaml when replaced by a new fact.
#   - Rejected queue items: Move here from queue.yaml when a reviewer decides
#     the item should not become a fact.
#
# SCOPE: Organization-wide. Mirrors the scope of facts.yaml and queue.yaml.

archive:

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Example: Deprecated fact (replaced by a newer fact)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # When a fact is superseded, move the full original entry here and add
  # the archive metadata fields (status, reason, replaced_by, archived_date,
  # archived_by). This preserves the original wording and context.
  #
  # Template:
  #
  # - path: <original category/name path>
  #   summary: "<original summary>"
  #   details: |
  #     <original details, preserved exactly as they were>
  #   original_confidence: <confidence level when it was active>
  #   status: deprecated
  #   reason: "<why this fact is no longer current>"
  #   replaced_by: <path of the new fact in facts.yaml, or null>
  #   archived_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  #   archived_by: human:<role> or agent:<role>

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Example: Rejected queue item
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # When a queue item is reviewed and determined not to be a valid fact,
  # move it here with the rejection context.
  #
  # Template:
  #
  # - id: <original Q-NNN id>
  #   category: <original category>
  #   summary: "<original summary>"
  #   details: |
  #     <original details, preserved exactly as they were>
  #   original_added_by: <who originally submitted it>
  #   status: rejected
  #   reason: "<why this was rejected - be specific so the context is clear>"
  #   archived_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  #   archived_by: human:<role> or agent:<role>

  # No archived items yet. This file will accumulate entries as facts are
  # deprecated and queue items are reviewed over time.
