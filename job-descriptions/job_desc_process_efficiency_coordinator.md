2. Review sample datasets showing the problem
3. Interview Data Collector about data source variability
4. Design standard unit conversion rules
5. Create specification for normalized data format
6. Pilot with 5 product evaluations

9. Train both agents on new standard
10. Monitor adoption and impact

**Outcome**: 
- Data Collector adds unit normalization step
- Quality Evaluator saves 30% time on comparisons
- Reduced errors from manual conversions

### Example 2: Reducing Escalation Frequency
**Situation**: High rate of kick-backs from Quality Evaluator to Data Collector for missing information

**DMAIC Application**:

**Define**: Reduce missing data escalations by 50%

**Measure**: 
- Baseline: 40% of evaluations require kick-back
- Top missing items: Material specifications, certifications, detailed dimensions

**Analyze**:
- Root cause: Data Collector checklist incomplete for certain product types
- Contributing factor: Some data sources don't prominently display required info

**Improve**:
- Create product-type-specific checklists
- Add verification step before handoff
- Provide guidance on where to find commonly missing data
- Add "data confidence" self-assessment before handoff

**Control**:
- Monitor kick-back rate weekly
- Update checklists as new product types encountered
- Quarterly review with both roles

**Outcome**:
- Kick-back rate reduced to 15%
- Cycle time decreased by 2 days on average
- Both roles report improved workflow

### Example 3: Lean Waste Elimination
**Situation**: Data Collector spends significant time gathering pricing data that Purchase Advisor recollects anyway

**Analysis**:
- **Waste Type**: Overproduction and Defects (Data Collector's pricing often stale by time Purchase Advisor runs)
- **Value Stream**: Data Collector provides snapshot pricing; Purchase Advisor needs current + historical

**Improvement**:
- Remove pricing collection from Data Collector role
- Data Collector provides product identification only (model numbers, variants)
- Purchase Advisor does all pricing research fresh
- Eliminates: redundant work, stale data issues, handoff of unnecessary information

**Outcome**:
- Data Collector saves 20% time per evaluation
- Purchase Advisor has more current data
- Reduced overall cycle time

### Example 4: Process Documentation Gap
**Situation**: New agent struggling to understand when to escalate ambiguity

**Activities**:
1. Interview struggling agent about specific decision points
2. Review decisions made by experienced agents in similar situations
3. Create decision tree for escalation scenarios
4. Document with clear examples:
   - When to proceed independently
   - When to request clarification from user
   - When to consult another role
   - When to flag uncertainty but proceed
5. Pilot with agent on next 3 evaluations
6. Refine based on effectiveness
7. Add to role documentation
8. Share with all agents

**Outcome**:
- Clearer decision-making guidelines
- Reduced unnecessary escalations
- Increased agent confidence
- Reusable for future agent onboarding
