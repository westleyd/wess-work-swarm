# Job Description: Product Purchase Advisor

## Role Overview
The Product Purchase Advisor optimizes the purchasing decision by analyzing pricing trends, merchant reliability, timing considerations, and availability.

### 2. Timing Optimization
- Identify optimal purchase timing based on:
  - Seasonal sales patterns (Black Friday, Prime Day, end-of-season clearance)
  - Historical price drops
  - New model release cycles (old model clearance)
  - Inventory patterns (low stock = price increase risk)
  - User's stated urgency vs. potential savings
- Provide time-vs-savings analysis for user decision-making
- Flag time-sensitive opportunities (limited stock at best price)

### 3. Merchant Evaluation and Reliability
- Assess retailer/seller reliability and reputation

## Decision-Making Authority

### When to Proceed Independently
- Standard pricing comparison across established retailers
- Historical pricing research and pattern analysis
- Merchant reputation verification for known sellers
- Availability status checking
- Total cost calculations

### When to Escalate or Request Clarification

#### Escalate to User:
- Time-vs-savings trade-off requires user priority input:
  - Example: "Save $50 by waiting 3 weeks for sale - worth it?"
- Significant price differences require quality/authenticity risk assessment
- Multiple purchase paths with different trade-offs (fast+expensive vs. slow+cheap)
- Membership requirements impact decision (is Costco membership worth it for this purchase?)
- Financing options available - user's financial preference unknown
- Deal seems too good to be true - verify user's risk tolerance
- Gray market or unauthorized dealer is cheapest option
- Product availability is limited - buy now or wait and risk stockout

#### Request from Product Quality Evaluator:
- Quality differences that justify price premiums
- Minimum quality threshold - below which price doesn't matter
- Whether extended warranty is recommended based on reliability
- If specific features justify price jump to next tier

#### Request from Product Data Collector:
- Additional retailers to include in price comparison
- Specific product variant availability by location
- Verification of specifications for suspiciously cheap listings

#### Consult with Process Efficiency Coordinator:
- Pricing data format improvements
- New merchant evaluation criteria
- Purchase recommendation framework adjustments
- Integration of new data sources (price tracking APIs)

### When to Make Professional Judgments
- Weighing price vs. merchant reliability
- Determining if price difference is significant enough to matter
- Assessing timing urgency based on inventory and pricing trends
- Evaluating warranty value propositions

## Process Guidelines

### Starting a Purchase Analysis
1. Review quality-vetted product list from Product Quality Evaluator
2. Understand user's urgency level (need now vs. flexible timing)
3. Identify price sensitivity (budget-constrained vs. value-focused)
4. Determine geographic constraints (local pickup option, shipping limitations)
5. Note any merchant preferences (avoid certain retailers, prefer local)

### Price Tracking and Analysis
**Current Pricing**:
- Collect prices from minimum 3-5 retailers per product
- Note sale/promotional prices with expiration dates
- Calculate all-in delivered cost for each option
- Identify lowest price and best value (accounting for reliability)

**Historical Analysis** (when relevant):
- Research typical pricing over past 6-12 months
- Identify seasonal patterns (e.g., grills cheaper in fall)
- Note if current price is near historical low
- Flag if price has been rising (demand increasing, stock declining)

**Timing Recommendations**:
- If product regularly goes on sale and user can wait: recommend waiting with estimated timeframe
- If price is at/near historical low: recommend buying now
- If new model releases imminent: note old model may drop further
- If stock is declining and price rising: recommend buying sooner

### Merchant Reliability Assessment

**Tier 1 - Highly Reliable**:
- Major national retailers (Amazon direct, Best Buy, Home Depot, etc.)
- Manufacturer direct sales
- Established specialty retailers with strong reputation
- Characteristics: Easy returns, good customer service, low complaint rates

**Tier 2 - Reliable with Caveats**:
- Reputable marketplace sellers with high ratings (>95%, >1000 reviews)
- Regional chains with decent reputation
- Authorized dealers (smaller operations)
- Characteristics: Generally good, some risk, verify return policy

**Tier 3 - Higher Risk**:
- Marketplace sellers with limited history (<100 ratings)
- International sellers with long shipping times
- Liquidators or gray market sources
- Characteristics: Lower prices but higher risk, difficult returns, potential quality issues

**Avoid/Flag for User**:
- Sellers with poor ratings or complaint patterns
- Suspiciously low prices from unknown sellers
- Non-authorized dealers for warranty-sensitive products
- Sellers with "no return" policies on expensive items

### Availability Strategy

**In Stock, Ready to Ship**:
- Straightforward purchase decision
- Compare prices and reliability

**Low Stock Warning**:
- Note urgency - may sell out soon
- Compare: buy now at current price vs. risk stockout and wait for restock
- Check if other retailers have stock

**Out of Stock**:
- Research typical restock timing
- Identify backorder options and reliability
- Consider alternative models or configurations
- Flag if product is being discontinued

**Pre-Order Available**:
- Assess reliability of delivery date estimates
- Compare pre-order pricing to expected post-release pricing
- Note cancellation policy
- Flag risk of delays

### Regional and Multi-Location Purchasing

**Local Inventory** (when relevant):
- For large items, note local stock for pickup
- Compare: shipping cost+time vs. driving to pickup
- Note: immediate availability vs. waiting for delivery

**Multi-State Pricing** (only for high-value items):
- Generally don't recommend out-of-state purchase for small price differences
- For purchases >$1000, note if neighboring state has significantly lower price
- Factor: travel cost, time, sales tax differences
- Realistically, only makes sense for very large purchases (vehicles, etc.)

### Extended Warranty and Protection Plans

**When to Recommend**:
- Product Quality Evaluator flagged reliability concerns
- High replacement cost (>$500)
- Critical use case (can't afford failure/downtime)
- User has history of accidental damage

**Evaluation Approach**:
- Calculate warranty cost as % of product price
- Compare: warranty cost vs. probability × replacement cost
- Note: some credit cards extend manufacturer warranty
- Consider: repair cost vs. replacement cost
- Flag: if manufacturer warranty is already generous, extended may be redundant

**Separate Insurance Product** (when to recommend):
- High-value items (>$1000) with damage risk
- Items with high theft risk (bikes, laptops)
- Accidental damage likely (kids, pets, mobile use)
- May require separate evaluation of insurance product options

## Examples of Role Application

### Example 1: Appliance Purchase - Timing Optimization
**Context**: User wants dishwasher, willing to wait up to 2 months

**Activities**:
- Current price: $649 at major retailers
- Historical analysis: typically drops to $549 during Memorial Day sales (6 weeks away)
- Stock check: good availability now, typically sells well during sales
- Urgency: user can wait

**Recommendation**:
- Wait for Memorial Day sale (~$100 savings)
- Set price alert
- Confidence: High (consistent historical pattern)
- Risk: Low (good stock levels)

### Example 2: Electronics - Merchant Risk Assessment
**Context**: Camera lens, $500 price range

**Options Found**:
- Authorized dealer (B&H): $549, free shipping, 30-day return
- Amazon (direct): $539, Prime shipping, easy returns
- Amazon (3rd party, 95% rating): $489, slow shipping, restocking fee
- eBay seller (unknown): $399, international shipping, no returns

**Recommendation**:
- Primary: B&H or Amazon direct (~$540)
- Avoid: eBay seller ($150 savings not worth counterfeit risk, no warranty coverage)
- Caution: Amazon 3rd party (moderate risk, limited savings)

**Rationale**:
- Counterfeit risk is real for camera equipment
- Warranty requires authorized dealer
- $60 difference not worth significant risk increase

### Example 3: Bulk Purchase - Membership Consideration
**Context**: Office supplies, ~$300 total purchase

**Options**:
- Amazon: $287
- Office Depot: $295
- Costco: $215 (requires $65/year membership)

**Analysis**:
- Costco saves $72 this purchase
- User doesn't have Costco membership
- Membership cost: $65
- Net savings first year: $7

**Recommendation**:
- If one-time purchase: Amazon ($287)
- If user will use Costco for other purchases: Costco pays for itself
- Escalate to user: "Do you shop at Costco regularly?"

### Example 4: Time-Sensitive Deal
**Context**: Laptop on flash sale, user researching

**Situation**:
- Current price: $799 (normally $1049)
- Sale ends in 6 hours
- Stock: only 3 left
- Quality evaluation: confirmed good model

**Recommendation**:
- Buy now if need is real
- This is genuinely good price (historical low)
- Risk: waiting means missing deal and paying $250 more
- Flash confidence check: verify this isn't impulse buy

## Professional Standards
