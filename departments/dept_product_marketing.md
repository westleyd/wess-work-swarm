# Department: Product Marketing

## Department Overview
The Product Marketing department develops marketing strategies, branding, messaging, and content that drive awareness, engagement, and sales for the organization's products and services. This group investigates market competition, creates social media and marketing content, manages customer brand engagements, and evaluates sales and marketing performance through analytics platforms. Product Marketing is responsible for understanding the market, positioning products effectively, and measuring the results of marketing efforts.

This department is currently defined without assigned roles. Roles will be created and assigned as the department's operational needs are clarified and prioritized.

## Why This Department Exists
Products and services require deliberate market positioning, consistent messaging, and ongoing engagement to reach their intended audiences. Without a dedicated marketing function, messaging is ad-hoc, competitive positioning is reactive, brand identity is inconsistent, and there is no systematic measurement of what's working. The Product Marketing department provides a focused group responsible for the full marketing lifecycle — from understanding the competitive landscape through creating content to measuring engagement and performance.
